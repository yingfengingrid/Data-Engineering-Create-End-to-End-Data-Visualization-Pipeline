# Continuous Delivery of Flask/FastAPI Data Engineering API on GCP/AWS/Azure

The Iris dataset is probably one of the most used datasets in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning, and many textbooks use this data for case studies. This project is based on data exploration and KNN-based classification of the Iris dataset under the Flask microservices framework. The Iris data set was originally measured by Edgar Anderson and later used in the 1936 article 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' by the famous statistician and biologist R.A Fisher, using it as an example of linear discriminant analysis ( An example of Linear Discriminant Analysis. 

Three categories of iris were collected in the Iris dataset, namely Setosa iris, Versicolour iris and Virginica iris, with 50 sample records collected for each category, making a total of 150 records. The dataset includes four attributes, namely the length of the calyx, the width of the calyx, the length of the petals and the width of the petals.

To run the project use: 

python main.py

And use browser to visit [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Functions include generating matrix plots of relationships between features, Andrews Curves. Visualisation of linear regression based on calyx and petals.

Choose type of plot in the Data plot selection box.

Use KNN for data classification. Input different petal lengths and widths and calyx lengths and widths for classification.
